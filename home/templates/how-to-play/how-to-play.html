            </p>
            <p class="h4 mb-3"><b>step 1:</b> Select a card from your hand to play, increasing your stats for the next
                battle.</p>
            <p class="h4 mb-3"><b>step 2:</b> Fight phase 1 to 4</p>
            <p class="h4 mb-3">In each phase u will be given the option to cast a spell or skip to the next phase. each
                spell has different phases in wich u can use them. And enemys have their own phases in wich they attack.</p>
            <p class="h4 mb-3">Keep an eye on your mana supply and plan your attacks carefully. You need to kill all
                enemies before the end of phase 4, not getting killed in the process....</p>
            <p class="h4 mb-3">The attacks unavailable to you will be grey in the attackbar.<br>
            This can be either because the phase or your mana doesn't allow you to play this spell at the moment.<br>
        Or of course you haven't learned this spell at all..</p>      
            <p class="h4 mb-3"><b>step 3:</b> Discard a card from your hand. You will draw 2 new cards after this.</p>

                to the top of the tower as fast as u can is your goal.<br>
